Know the Concepts:

• Describe the fetch-execute cycle.
    - It is essentialy the process of reading the memory intructions one at a time, and executing it.
    - The following is the outline of the process:
        1. Read the program counter for the next address containing an instruction.
	2. Decode the fetched instruction, which decides what operation that needs to be done.
	3. Use the databus to fetch involved memory locations
	4. Pass the fetched data to the logic and arithmetic unit for execution.


• What is a register? How would computation be more difficult without registers?
    - A register is a location where we process the fetched data.
    - It would be more difficult to decide what memory to dedicate to execution.
  
• How do you represent numbers larger than 255?
    - Since we use a byte or 8 bits to represent 0-255 on each address, we will need to occupy and combine 
      more than one address to represent larger numbers.
  
• How big are the registers on the machines we will be using?
    - Since we will be using an x86 architecture, the registers will be 4 bytes or 1 word long.
    - Conversely, should we use an x64 architecture, then we would be able to use 8 bytes or 2 words long registers.
 
• How does a computer know how to interpret a given byte or set of bytes of memory?
    - Inherently it doesn't know, since all values are stored equally and the way in which we access them, is what
      determines what it does.
 
• What are the addressing modes and what are they used for?
    - Immidiate mode:
        -> Indicates that the current instruction is the value to use. 
    - Register addressing mode:
        -> The instruction contains which register to access.
    - Direct addressing mode:
        -> The instruction contains a memory address to go to next. 
    - Indirect addressing mode:
        -> Instruction contains a register with a pointer pointing towards the data that needs to be accessed.
    - Indexed addressing mode:
        -> Instruction contains an offset number used to jump a set amount like a byte or a word.
    - Base pointer addressing mode
        -> Similar to indirect pointer mode, but includes an offset.

• What does the instruction pointer do?
    - It denotes if a memory location is an instruction, the computer would have no idea which was what without it. 

Use the Concepts

• What data would you use in an employee record? How would you lay it out in memory?
    - I would use the following layout: 
    Start of record:
        names (50 bytes) = 	50 ASCII characters for surname and lastname 	- Start of record
	addresses (30 bytes) = 	30 ASCII characters for adresss 		- Start of record + 50
	id (1 word - 4 bytes) = 4 ASCII characters for id number 		- Start of record + 100
	mail (50 bytes) = 	50 ASCII characters for email 			- Start of record + 104

    - You could reasonably justify a static length record, since things such as names and 
      addresses tend to be inside a certain length.
      The downside is, that there is a potential for a lot of "wasted" space, 
      if the entries does not occupy all the allocated space.

• If I had the pointer the the beginning of the employee record above, and wanted to access a
  particular piece of data inside of it, what addressing mode would I use?
    - You would use Indexed addressing mode, since we want to go a certain amount of bytes from the current address.
  
• In base pointer addressing mode, if you have a register holding the value 3122, and an offset of
  20, what address would you be trying to access?
    - We would then try and access the address of 3142, since we add the offset to the value in base pointer addressing mode.

• In indexed addressing mode, if the base address is 6512, the index register has a 5, and the
  multiplier is 4, what address would you be trying to access?
    - 
• In indexed addressing mode, if the base address is 123472, the index register has a 0, and the
  multiplier is 4, what address would you be trying to access?
• In indexed addressing mode, if the base address is 9123478, the index register has a 20, and the
  multiplier is 1, what address would you be trying to access?

Going Further
• What are the minimum number of addressing modes needed for computation?
• Why include addressing modes that aren’t strictly needed?
• Research and then describe how pipelining (or one of the other complicating factors) affects
the fetch-execute cycle.
• Research and then describe the tradeoffs between fixed-length instructions and variable-length
instructions.
